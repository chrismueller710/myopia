# myopia
The primary objective of this study is to identify and analyze the various factors that may contribute to the onset of myopia in children.
Full Disclosure: This project was made with the help of some of my other classmates in my Categorical Data Analysis class, though I have removed their names from the paper.
There are parts of this project that I will admit aren't the most "professional" in some of the words and pictures used.
